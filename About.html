    <h1>About Cloud 7</h1>
    <p>Supporting mental wellness through compassion, understanding, and safe spaces</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <h3>Supporting Those Who Struggle with Mental Blocks</h3>
    <p>Cloud 7 was created to address a fundamental truth: mental health challenges are real, valid, and deserve compassionate support. We've experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to express feelings and seek help.</p>
    <p>That's why we've built a platform that prioritizes listening, understanding, and providing safe spaces for healing—whether through mood tracking, journaling, or connecting with professionals who care.</p>

    <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty expressing feelings and emotions</li>
        <li>Fear of judgment when seeking help</li>
        <li>Mental blocks preventing goal achievement</li>
        <li>Limited access to affordable mental health support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compassion First:</strong> We believe in listening before solving, understanding before advising.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy & Trust:</strong> Your journey is yours alone. We protect your data and confidentiality above all.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> No one should face mental health challenges alone. We're building a supportive community.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Combining technology with human care to make mental health support accessible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
    <h3>Listening Over Solutions</h3>
    <p>We understand that sometimes people need to be heard more than they need advice. Our platform emphasizes journaling and reflection, giving you space to process emotions at your own pace.</p>
    <h3>Anonymity & Safety</h3>
    <p>For those who aren't comfortable sharing their identity, we offer anonymous session options. Creating a sense of safety is our top priority.</p>
    <h3>Affordable Access</h3>
    <p>Mental health support shouldn't be a luxury. We offer affordable subscription models and partnerships with NHS, schools, and employers to make help accessible.</p>
    <h3>Track Your Progress</h3>
    <p>Mood tracking and journaling create a tangible record of your journey. Looking back at how far you've come can be incredibly motivating.</p>

    <h2>Our Partners</h2>
    <p>Working Together for Better Mental Health</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NHS:</strong> Partnered for accessible mental health services</li>
        <li><strong>Schools & Universities:</strong> Supporting student mental wellness programs</li>
        <li><strong>Employers:</strong> Workplace mental health initiatives</li>
        <li><strong>Licensed Professionals:</strong> Network of qualified therapists and counselors</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Personal Journey</h2>
    <blockquote>"As someone who's personally struggled with mental health, and has known others who have also struggled, I know how important it is to have a listening ear rather than someone who strictly gives solutions to problems."</blockquote>
    <p>Cloud 7 was built from this understanding. It's more than a platform—it's a commitment to supporting every person on their unique mental wellness journey, providing the tools and connections they need to heal and grow.</p>
